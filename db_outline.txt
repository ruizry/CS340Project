Outline

The database represents the collection of data for a Gym franchise.  The data is
intended to track the people in the gym, be it employees or members.  We are able
to track who works at the gym, what position they hold, and if they teach one of
the workout classes that the gym has at one of its many locations.

This database would theoretically allow Gym employees to quickly add and remove
other employees (something maybe a hiring manager might do) and assign trainers some
classes to teach.  On the member side of things, this would allow the registration
of new members to the Gym and also be able to see if they are an active member.
What makes this a flexible tool for our theoretical users is that you are able to
see data across multiple locations and not just one, allowing you to see a bigger
picture of the people structure of the gym franchise.
